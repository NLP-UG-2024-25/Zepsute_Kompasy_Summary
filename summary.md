Summary 

    The chapter describes that in 19th Century philologist Jacob Grimm established a sound change know as the Grimm’s Law. This helped distinguish Germanic branch of language from other Indo-European Languages. It denotes for example the shift from Indo-European /p/ to Germanic /f/, this is one of the features that can show distinction between language families and show that English is a Germanic language. 
	However the author of the book points out that comparing cognate vocabulary is not the only way to prove that languages should be classified into families of similar ones. Big part of comparing languages is also their grammar and the similarities in grammar structure of various languages. The chapter notes that most Indo-European languages contain inflection which marks case, number and gender on nouns, adjectives and sometimes articles. The author of the chapter goes on to explain how these markers were present in PIE language. Further in the chapter the author presents a table with comparison of Latin and English showcasing that some PIE languages have a more complex morphology than others. The author explains the morphology of Latin as compared to English it is a highly inflectional language, showing how the Latin equivalent of the English word „girl” is inflected using cases (Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, Ablative, Vocative) and number (singular or plural). Latin here is contrasted with English and German, proving that adjectives in Latin are also inflected. The author explains that English has a rather simplified system for marking case, number and gender mostly highlighting them with the use of determinatives such as this/these.
