Summary 

    The chapter describes that in 19th Century philologist Jacob Grimm established a sound change know as the Grimm’s Law. This helped distinguish Germanic branch of language from other Indo-European Languages. It denotes for example the shift from Indo-European /p/ to Germanic /f/, this is one of the features that can show distinction between language families and show that English is a Germanic language. 
	However the author of the book points out that comparing cognate vocabulary is not the only way to prove that languages should be classified into families of similar ones. Big part of comparing languages is also their grammar and the similarities in grammar structure of various languages. The chapter notes that most Indo-European languages contain inflection which marks case, number and gender on nouns, adjectives and sometimes articles. The author of the chapter goes on to explain how these markers were present in PIE language. Further in the chapter the author presents a table with comparison of Latin and English showcasing that some PIE languages have a more complex morphology than others. The author explains the morphology of Latin as compared to English it is a highly inflectional language, showing how the Latin equivalent of the English word „girl” is inflected using cases (Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, Ablative, Vocative) and number (singular or plural). Latin here is contrasted with English and German, proving that adjectives in Latin are also inflected. The author explains that English has a rather simplified system for marking case, number and gender mostly highlighting them with the use of determinatives such as this/these. 
    The next section explores the codification and standardization of English during the Modern English period, highlighting the publication of major grammar and dictionaries like Samuel Johnson’s 1755 dictionary or Noah Webster’s 1806 dictionary. Attempts to create an “English Academy” similar to the French Academy were unsuccessful, but these efforts signified a growing concern for documenting and prescribing the language.
    There is also a mention of the transition from Middle to Modern English, explaining how vowels were raised in the vowel chart or became diphthongs, and visualizing the process of analyzing vowels to put them in the vowel chart. The chapter then examines the impact of colonization, focusing on how the colonization of America and the rise of the United States as a superpower spread English globally, leading to the emergence of many new varieties of English.
    Next, the text discusses typological language classification, which groups languages by shared linguistic structures, such as word order, rather than by historical relationships. English is categorized as an SVO language.
